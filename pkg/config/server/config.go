	// Note that for the Lambda Server we can't know the timeouts set

	// In most cases the Lambdas will send a response message when they
	// time out, but we also have a fail safe timeout here for cases
	// where a Lambda fails between receiving a request and sending a
	// response. This timeout needs to be higher than the highest
	// expected legitimate Lambda timeout. We set the default to be
	// 1800 seconds (30 minutes) as that is twice the AWS Lambda max
	// timeout of 15 minutes and also happens to be the RabbitMQ ack
	// timeout where the broker closes a channel if a message acknowledge
	// hasn't occurred within 30 minutes of the message being delivered.
	// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-timeout-console

	// Invocation requests to non-existent/non-deployed Lambdas are
	// identified quickly as requests are published with Mandatory set
	// true, so if they are unroutable the will be returned by the broker
	// so the purpose of this timeout is to cater for cases where
	// the requests have actually succeeded, but the Lambda fails to
	// respond at all.
